# Boot verification with xemu

Status: **xemu installed, blocked on firmware.**

## What is in place

- xemu `0.8.139` (debug AppImage) on the desktop at `~/tools/xemu.AppImage`; it starts and reads its
  settings from `~/.local/share/xemu/xemu/`, so it can run with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` for a
  headless smoke test of the emulator itself.
- The dump is staged on the desktop's NAS mount at `~/nfs/sg1-dump/Stargate_SG-1_-_The_Alliance-2005-12-15`
  (outside this repository, never committed): verified **4,006 files / 2.2 GB**, `default.xbe`
  present, so xemu can take the directory as its DVD image with no copying at test time.
- `tools/xemu/boot-test.sh` runs the emulator with the debug-kit configuration the plan requires
  (128 MB, serial log to a file, DVD path = the game directory) and reports whether the guest stayed
  alive for N seconds.

## What is missing, and why it is not downloadable

xemu needs the console's own firmware:

| File | Size | Why it cannot be fetched here |
|---|---|---|
| `mcpx_1.0.bin` | 512 B | Microsoft's MCPX boot ROM — proprietary firmware, no legal download |
| flash ROM (`complex_4627.bin`, `Xbox_4627_v1.0.bin`, …) | 256 KB / 512 KB | same: a dump of the console's flash, model-specific |
| `xbox_hdd.qcow2` | n/a | xemu creates a blank one on first boot, so this is not a blocker |

Searched the desktop and the NAS for firmware (any `mcpx*`, any 200–700 KB `.bin`, any `.qcow2`):
nothing on either, so there is no existing file to point the runner at.

This project will not download, mirror or commit firmware. Supplying it is the owner's call under
`docs/LEGAL.md` ("do not commit emulator BIOS files"), and the file has to come from a console the
user owns — or the user points at one they already have.

## Running it

```sh
# on the desktop
~/nfs/Projects/stargate-alliance-decomp/tools/xemu/boot-test.sh \
    ~/nfs/sg1-dump/Stargate_SG-1_-_The_Alliance-2005-12-15 \
    ~/xbox-bios \
    120
```

`boot-test.sh` fails fast with a clear message if `mcpx*.bin` or a flash ROM is absent, so a wrong
path never looks like a crash.

## What the boot test can and cannot prove

- **Can**: the emulator reaches the game (title screen survives N seconds), the serial log shows the
  engine's own output, and a crash/assert surfaces as the process exiting early.
- **Cannot (yet)**: a screenshot. xemu's screenshot path is a UI action, and a headless run has no
  window; adding `-display none` style capture or a KVM frame capture is a follow-up under 7.2.
- The specific claim this test should settle first is the chapter-list one from
  `docs/CUT_CONTENT.md`: the campaign menu should fail to load its maps because
  `ChapterList.ini` names `M02AX.unr` etc. while the build ships `M02A.unr`.
