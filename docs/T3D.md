# T3D: values, references, and what a spawner points at

The T3D writer from the previous step produced actor *names* and sizes. This adds the values, and in doing so
answers a question the AI system doc had recorded as unanswerable.

## What changed

* **Property values decode.** Values inside a package's property stream are *compact* — a name or object
  reference is one or two bytes, not a fixed four — and a vector arrives as `Struct(Vector)`, not as a
  `Vector` type. Reading them by assumed width is why `Location` and `Squad` came out empty on the first
  attempt.
* **Object references resolve** to `Class'Name'` form (`SQUAD_JaffaSerpentL_Single'SQUAD_…2'`) instead of
  `ref:<index>`.

Measured over the same 73 maps:

| | |
|---|---:|
| actors written | 121,225 |
| actors carrying a `Location` with coordinates | **111,520** |
| distinct `SuggestedSquadScript` values | **601** |
| maps whose spawners reference a squad script | **61 of 73** |
| references that do not resolve (`?`) | 820 |

`inventory/squad_scripts.csv` holds (map, squad script, spawner count) — 614 rows of identifiers.

## Spawners point at named AI scripts

`IntelligentSpawner` never names a bot class. Its properties are `SpawningRate`, `Squad`,
`SuggestedSquadScript`, `spawnPriority` and `bForceSpawn`, and `SuggestedSquadScript` carries a *script class*
name — `AI_Jaffa_Horus_Med_single`, `AI_Jaffa_Horus_Med_Obs`, `Jaffa_Enc5`, `TSS_7A_B_Jaffa_01`. So the chain
from a mission to its enemies runs:

```
map → IntelligentSpawner → SuggestedSquadScript (a class) → that class's default roster → bot classes
```

The first two links are now measured. The third is a **class default**, which is the one part of the package
format this reader still cannot reach (`docs/ACTOR_PROPERTIES.md`: class objects have no property block). So
"which bots does mission 7 use" is answerable *by encounter script name* today, and by bot class only once
defaults parse.

## Correcting an earlier claim

`docs/systems/AI.md` said "no AI class is placed in any map… so 'which bots does this mission use' is not
answerable from the `.unr` alone". Half of that stands — no bot *class* is placed. But the map does name the
encounter script that will spawn them, 61 of 73 maps carry such names, and the names are explicit about what
they spawn. The doc now says that instead.

## Still not measured

* The 820 unresolved references, and the 18 `?` squad scripts. They cluster rather than scatter, which points
  at references to imports this reader does not index, not at random corruption — but that is a hypothesis.
* Class defaults, above.
* The `Level` export's script sequence: the `ACTION_*` actors' parameters are visible, their order is not.
