# The class constructor chain, and the second copy of it in the image

`inventory/class_constructors.csv` names a constructor for every class the image builds, from the
class table each one installs. Four of those tables are the whole UE2 object model, and their
constructors chain: `UObject` (`0x004dd2a8`), `UStruct` (`0x004d4418`), `UState` (`0x004d4570`) and
`UClass` (`0x004d4870`), each ctor installing its own table last and calling its base ctor first.

`UClass`'s registration ctor is `0x0003af60`: the 493 `ucpp_*` stubs call it with a class literal and
a flags word, and `tools/class-flag-stores.py` reads the flags it composes out of those 493 sites
(`docs/systems/CHECKPOINTS.md`, *How a bit can reach the class flag word*). That note closed with a
second `UClass` ctor in the image -- `0x0003c430`, found by the `int3`-padding rule, called by nothing
-- and nominated the pair `0x0003c430`/`0x0003bd30` against `0x0003af60`/`0x0003a5f0` as the next
measurement: *what did the linker keep a copy for?*

`tools/native-unreachable.py` answers it, and answers the general question behind it. A body is
**unreachable** when no byte of the image points at it, counting every way this build points at code:
a relative `E8` call, a relative `E9` jump, or a dword in any section equal to the start (a table
slot, a registration table, a `push imm32`). The population is `symbols/xbox_functions.csv` plus the
bodies that begin at the image's own `int3` padding and carry no map entry. A body whose every
inbound edge comes from a body that is itself unreachable goes too, so the answer is a fixpoint and
not a single in-degree count -- which is what makes `0x0003bd30` dead although it has two callers.

<!-- generated:native-unreachable -->
**3779 of the image's 19507 bodies are unreachable, and the copy the previous note nominated is one of them.** The population is the 14973 bodies `symbols/xbox_functions.csv` names plus the 4534 that start at the image's own `int3` padding and carry no map entry; an edge is a relative `E8` call, a relative `E9` jump, or a dword in any section equal to the start. 3341 bodies have no outside edge at all, and 438 more lose theirs once bodies whose callers are all in that set are followed to a fixpoint -- **3779 in total (3106 the map names, 673 found only by padding), in 433 runs, 799 of them carrying a real name and 1857 starting on a 4-byte boundary.** Both facts about a start are kept per row: a body the map names at an odd address that nothing references may be a definition Ghidra invented over data, and this measurement does not separate that from dead code.

**The unreachable bodies are not scattered: they form 433 runs, and the biggest single run is 362 bodies over 0x49f360-0x4aa5d8, of which 114 start on a 4-byte boundary.** A run is a set of unreachable bodies no more than `0x400` apart; a run that starts and ends inside live code is what a dropped translation unit looks like, and a run whose starts are mostly off a 4-byte boundary is more likely the map's own definitions over data -- which is why each run row carries both numbers.

**The nominated pair is a second compilation of the class constructor family, with the State constructor inlined into it.** Read from the bodies themselves:

| body | what it is | installs | base call | zeroes | outside edges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x03af60` | registration ctor (493 call sites) | `0x4d4870` | `0x3a5f0` | 25 stores | 493 |
| `0x03c430` | the copy the previous note nominated | `0x4d4870` | `0x3bd30` | the +0x80 block | 0 |
| `0x03a5f0` | base the registration ctor calls | `0x4d4570` | `0x62470` | the +0x80 block | 1 |
| `0x03bd30` | base the nominated copy calls | `0x4d4418` | `0x3b440` | 13 stores | 2 |
| `0x03c3d0` | sibling copy: installs the State table | `0x4d4570` | `0x3bd30` | the +0x80 block | 0 |

Two things follow from the table. **First, the copy installs the same class table as the registration ctor (`0x4d4870`) and sets the same flags, but its base call goes to `0x3bd30`, which installs `0x4d4418` -- the Struct table -- while the live ctor's base call goes to `0x3a5f0` and installs `0x4d4570`, the State table.** The block each body clears separates the two readings: the copy carries the +0x80 block, the sibling at ``0x03c3d0`` -- which installs the State table itself -- carries the +0x80 block, the live State ctor carries the +0x80 block, and the live Class ctor carries 25 stores. A Class ctor that clears the block its State base clears, with the State table install dropped, is the State ctor inlined into it, and then the base call can only go to the class below State.

**Second, nothing references it: the copy has 0 outside edges and its base has 2, and both of those base edges come from inside the same unreachable set** (`0x03c3f2` in the State copy, `0x03c45c` in the Class copy). So the reference graph is closed under the family: no call, no jump and no dword in any section enters it. It is therefore not a copy the linker kept *for* a reference -- nothing can call it. Whether it survived as an unswept body or lost a COMDAT pick is not decidable from the image; that it is unreachable is.

## What the copy is not

It is **not** a copy kept for a reference. Its only inbound edges are the two call sites on its base
ctor, and both sit inside the unreachable set; no table slot anywhere names either body. It is also
**not** the registration ctor with a different argument list: it clears a block of fields the
registration ctor never touches, and it skips the table install that the State ctor would perform.

## What the copy is

A second compilation of the same source constructors, with `UState`'s ctor inlined into `UClass`'s.
Inlining a base ctor drops the base's table install as a dead store and hoists the base's own base
call, so an inlined `UClass` ctor calls `UStruct`'s ctor directly and carries the six stores that
clear `+0x80..+0x94` -- the only work `UState`'s ctor does outside its table install. `0x0003c3d0`
is the same source before that inlining: it installs the State table itself and carries the same six
stores. The live `UClass` ctor carries neither, because it calls `UState`'s ctor out of line.

## What this measurement does not say

- **It does not separate dead code from map artefacts.** A body the symbol map names at an odd
  address that nothing references may be a definition Ghidra invented over data; the artifact keeps
  the start kind (`map`/`pad`), the alignment and the reference count on every row so the two can be
  told apart by a later read, and the rendered counts are split by start kind.
- **It does not claim a body is cut content.** Native code being unreachable says nothing about the
  scripts or the maps; `tools/class-reach.py` is the instrument for that question.
- **It does not read what a computed jump cannot show.** A body reached only through a jump table that
  holds offsets rather than addresses (an opcode dispatch table, say) would be reported unreachable.
  No such table is known in this image, but the census is a lower bound on reachability for that
  reason, and the resident `GNatives` table (`docs/NATIVE_VM.md`) is a table of addresses, which the
  dword scan does read.
